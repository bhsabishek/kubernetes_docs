1. For setting up the HA kubernetes cluster we followed the piyush sachdev lecture and we used HAProxy setup. Below are the questions after going through that video
    a. What if the one HAProxy server is down? are there any other methods to make HAProxy server make available?
        Recommended architecture
          1. Two (or three) HAProxy nodes running on separate hosts/AZs.
          2. Keepalived (VRRP) to provide a floating VIP that points to the active HAProxy; HAProxy forwards TCP 6443 to all master API servers.
          3. Health checks: HAProxy should probe each API server; Keepalived should demote a node if HAProxy fails health checks.
          4. Monitoring & automation: Prometheus/Alertmanager + automated replacement (cloud autoscaling or Ansible) for failed LB nodes.
          5. Configuration management: Store HAProxy config in Git and deploy via Ansible/Terraform to avoid config drift.

    b. How to setup the multiple HAProxy servers?
